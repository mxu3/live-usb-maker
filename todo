2. users need to be told in readme upfront about:
 - relation to "antix2usb" from mx-tools : is live-usb-maker a replacement of a.2.u. ? an improvement ? or what ?
 - looks like booting is done differently in anbtix2usb and this live-USB-maker. will the kernel-updater be compatible with both?

3. which live-maker is preferrable and why: antix2usb or live-usb-maker
